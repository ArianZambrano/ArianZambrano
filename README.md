About Me
========
I'm is Arian Zambrano and I study Software Engeenering at San Marcos University in Lima, Perú. 

Programming is one of my greatest passions, and I work everyday on becoming a skillful software developer.

My main interests are Web Development, specifically Front-End; and Artificial Intelligence. I also have skills on Software Project Management, leadership and teamwork. I´m a easy going person.

I enjoy doing other activities besides programming; like playing guitar, writing and talking about anything.
